<summary>‚ö† <b>WARN:</b> Is the command `ftxvalidator` (Apple Font Tool Suite) available?</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/ftxvalidator_is_available](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/universal.html#com.google.fonts/check/ftxvalidator_is_available)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

There&#x27;s no reasonable (and legal) way to run the command `ftxvalidator` of the
Apple Font Tool Suite on a non-macOS machine. I.e. on GNU+Linux or Windows etc.

If Font Bakery is not running on an OSX machine, the machine running Font
Bakery could access `ftxvalidator` on OSX, e.g. via ssh or a remote procedure
call (rpc).

There&#x27;s an ssh example implementation at:
https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery/blob/master/prebuilt/workarounds
/ftxvalidator/ssh-implementation/ftxvalidator

* ‚ö† **WARN** Could not find ftxvalidator.

<summary>üî• <b>FAIL:</b> Check name table: FONT_FAMILY_NAME entries.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/name/familyname](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/name/familyname)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Checks that the family name infered from the font filename matches the string
at nameID 1 (NAMEID_FONT_FAMILY_NAME) if it conforms to RIBBI and otherwise
checks that nameID 1 is the family name + the style name.


</pre>

* üî• **FAIL** Entry [FONT_FAMILY_NAME(1):MACINTOSH(1)] on the "name" table: Expected "Shippori Antique" but got "„Åó„Å£„ÅΩ„Çä„Ç¢„É≥„ÉÅ„ÉÉ„ÇØ". [code: mismatch]
* üî• **FAIL** Entry [FONT_FAMILY_NAME(1):WINDOWS(3)] on the "name" table: Expected "Shippori Antique" but got "„Åó„Å£„ÅΩ„Çä„Ç¢„É≥„ÉÅ„ÉÉ„ÇØ". [code: mismatch]

<summary>üî• <b>FAIL:</b> Checking OS/2 usWinAscent & usWinDescent.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/family/win_ascent_and_descent](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/universal.html#com.google.fonts/check/family/win_ascent_and_descent)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

A font&#x27;s winAscent and winDescent values should be greater than the head
table&#x27;s yMax, abs(yMin) values. If they are less than these values, clipping
can occur on Windows platforms
(https://github.com/RedHatBrand/Overpass/issues/33).

If the font includes tall/deep writing systems such as Arabic or Devanagari,
the winAscent and winDescent can be greater than the yMax and abs(yMin) to
accommodate vowel marks.

When the win Metrics are significantly greater than the upm, the linespacing
can appear too loose. To counteract this, enabling the OS/2 fsSelection bit 7
(Use_Typo_Metrics), will force Windows to use the OS/2 typo values instead.
This means the font developer can control the linespacing with the typo values,
whilst avoiding clipping by setting the win values to values greater than the
yMax and abs(yMin).


</pre>

* üî• **FAIL** OS/2.usWinDescent value should be equal or greater than 336, but got 288 instead. [code: descent]

<summary>üî• <b>FAIL:</b> Checking OS/2 Metrics match hhea Metrics.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/os2_metrics_match_hhea](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/universal.html#com.google.fonts/check/os2_metrics_match_hhea)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

When OS/2 and hhea vertical metrics match, the same linespacing results on
macOS, GNU+Linux and Windows. Unfortunately as of 2018, Google Fonts has
released many fonts with vertical metrics that don&#x27;t match in this way. When we
fix this issue in these existing families, we will create a visible change in
line/paragraph layout for either Windows or macOS users, which will upset some
of them.

But we have a duty to fix broken stuff, and inconsistent paragraph layout is
unacceptably broken when it is possible to avoid it.

If users complain and prefer the old broken version, they have the freedom to
take care of their own situation.

* üî• **FAIL** OS/2 sTypoAscender (880) and hhea ascent (1160) must be equal. [code: ascender]

<summary>‚ö† <b>WARN:</b> Checking OS/2 achVendID.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/vendor_id](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/vendor_id)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Microsoft keeps a list of font vendors and their respective contact info. This
list is updated regularly and is indexed by a 4-char &quot;Vendor ID&quot; which is
stored in the achVendID field of the OS/2 table.

Registering your ID is not mandatory, but it is a good practice since some
applications may display the type designer / type foundry contact info on some
dialog and also because that info will be visible on Microsoft&#x27;s website:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/vendors/

This check verifies whether or not a given font&#x27;s vendor ID is registered in
that list or if it has some of the default values used by the most common font
editors.

Each new FontBakery release includes a cached copy of that list of vendor IDs.
If you registered recently, you&#x27;re safe to ignore warnings emitted by this
check, since your ID will soon be included in one of our upcoming releases.


</pre>

* ‚ö† **WARN** OS/2 VendorID value 'FTDS' is not yet recognized. If you registered it recently, then it's safe to ignore this warning message. Otherwise, you should set it to your own unique 4 character code, and register it with Microsoft at https://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/vendorlist.aspx

<summary>‚ö† <b>WARN:</b> Check if each glyph has the recommended amount of contours.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/contour_count](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/contour_count)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be
constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph&#x27;s contour count will
only differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a &#x27;g&#x27; could either be 2 or 3
contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.

However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a
display family.

This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there&#x27;s plenty of
alternative ways of constructing glyphs with multiple outlines for each feature
in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently
optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.


</pre>

* ‚ö† **WARN** This check inspects the glyph outlines and detects the total number of contours in each of them. The expected values are infered from the typical ammounts of contours observed in a large collection of reference font families. The divergences listed below may simply indicate a significantly different design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint. Please consider reviewing the design and codepoint assignment of these to make sure they are correct.

The following glyphs do not have the recommended number of contours:

Glyph name: a	Contours detected: 3	Expected: 2
Glyph name: agrave	Contours detected: 4	Expected: 3
Glyph name: aacute	Contours detected: 4	Expected: 3
Glyph name: acircumflex	Contours detected: 4	Expected: 3
Glyph name: atilde	Contours detected: 4	Expected: 3
Glyph name: adieresis	Contours detected: 5	Expected: 4
Glyph name: aring	Contours detected: 5	Expected: 4
Glyph name: a	Contours detected: 3	Expected: 2
Glyph name: aacute	Contours detected: 4	Expected: 3
Glyph name: acircumflex	Contours detected: 4	Expected: 3

<summary>‚ö† <b>WARN:</b> Are there caret positions declared for every ligature?</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/ligature_carets](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/ligature_carets)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

All ligatures in a font must have corresponding caret (text cursor) positions
defined in the GDEF table, otherwhise, users may experience issues with caret
rendering.

If using GlyphsApp, ligature carets can be set directly on canvas by accessing
the `Glyph -&gt; Set Anchors` menu option or by pressing the `Cmd+U` keyboard
shortcut.
